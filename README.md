# GroceryBagger
Java program that roughly simulates a grocery bagger sifting through grocies and organizing them in a bag or bags based on each grocery item's attributes. The Eclipse IDE was used to facilitate this program's creation. A .txt file with a set of test values is provided with this project, as well as an output-testing program.
